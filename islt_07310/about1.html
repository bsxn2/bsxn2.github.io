  <h1>Educator Credentials</h1>
  <h2> <img src="brianna.JPG"> </h2>
<p1>My name is Brianna Shipp and I have worked as an educator in a public school district for seven years. I am a 
            mother of two daughters. I have a Master's degree in Educational Technology from <em>Lindenwood University</em>. I attended <em>Harris Stowe State University</em>, where I earned my Bachelor's in Education with an 
            emphasis in Social Sciences. Currently, I am a member of the School of Information Science and Learning 
            Technologies and working on my Ed. S degree in Learning Technology from the University of Missouri. I 
            am certified to teach grades 5-9 and have worked with middle school students in grades six, seven, and 
            eight. Throughout my career, I have developed a passion for presenting my students with the 
            opportunity to enhance their learning using technology. Recently, I have developed the desire to aid 
            fellow educators in expanding their pedagogy to include strategies and tools centered around 
            technology incorporation in the classroom. <a href="Shipp_Resume.pdf" >Check out my resume.</a>.</p>
